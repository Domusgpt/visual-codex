### Headless Agentic Polytope Visualizer (for PMK/ASI)

*   **File Path:** `/mnt/c/Users/millz/Desktop/visualizer-core-refactor-kernal/README.md` (and associated JS files)
*   **Dependencies:** WebGL, JavaScript (API-driven)
*   **Visual Description:** This is a headless WebGL module for visualizing N-dimensional polytopes and dynamic geometric forms. It's designed to be controlled programmatically by an external agent (like PMK or ASI) to represent abstract data, active schemas, or system states. The visualizer can display various polytopes (Hypercube, Hypersphere, Hypertetrahedron, Duocylinder) with configurable dimensions, projection methods, and visual styling (morphing, rotation, color, line characteristics). The primary goal is clear topological representation of agent-observed states.
*   **Key Features & Effects:**
    *   **API-Driven Control:** All visual parameters are controlled programmatically, allowing an AI agent to dynamically set geometry, dimensionality, appearance, and data mapping.
    *   **Diverse Polytope Library:** Supports a range of N-dimensional polytopes for representing different data types or system states.
    *   **Configurable N-Dimensions:** The number of dimensions for calculations can be set via API, influencing the underlying structure.
    *   **Selectable Projection Methods:** Various projection techniques (Perspective, Orthographic, Stereographic) for viewing higher-dimensional structures.
    *   **Direct Data Channel Mapping:** Designed to receive data streams that directly drive visual properties, providing feedback on agent-observed states.
    *   **Headless Operation:** Optimized for integration as a module without a direct human-operated UI, primarily for debugging, monitoring agent states, or programmatic visual output.
*   **Code Highlights (from `README.md`):**
    *   "The visualizer's parameters are intended to be **machine-settable controls**, allowing an external agent to dynamically represent data states, active schemas, abstract data topologies, or system focus through the choice and configuration of displayed polytopes."
    *   "**Direct Data Channel Mapping:** Designed to receive data streams (e.g., from PMK/ASI `dataChannels` or `PMKData` objects) that directly drive visual properties like morphing, rotation, color, and line characteristics, providing clear feedback on agent-observed states."
