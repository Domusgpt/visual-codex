// Changed from local variable to class property
this.mobileContentSets = [ /* content sets */ ];
```
**Result**: ✅ Now showing 3 cards correctly

**Problem**: "ZT is not defined" error from CDN failure
**Root Cause**: JSDelivr CDN returning 404 for ZingTouch library
**Solution**: 
- Changed CDN from `jsdelivr` to `unpkg`
- Added fallback native touch handling when ZingTouch fails
**Result**: ⚠️ Library still not loading but graceful fallback working

### **Minor Issue: Service Worker Registration** ⚠️
**Problem**: SW.js file not found (404 error)
