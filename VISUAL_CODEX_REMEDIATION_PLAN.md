# Visual Codex Remediation Plan

This document outlines the plan for systematically addressing issues and enhancing the Visual Codex demos. The previous attempt at a universal collapsible menu system proved problematic and has been fully reverted. The new approach focuses on demo-specific solutions and a phased remediation process.

## Phase 1: Reversion and Initial Cleanup (Completed)

*   **Objective:** Remove all traces of the problematic universal collapsible menu system and restore demos to their pre-modification state where possible.
*   **Actions Taken:**
    *   Deleted `js/universal-collapsible-menu.js`.
    *   Deleted `js/inject-collapsible-menu.js`.
    *   Removed `<script>` tags and `window.COLLAPSIBLE_MENU_CONFIG` blocks from the following HTML files:
        *   `demos/active-holographic-systems-mega-demo.html`
        *   `demos/moire-hypercube-codex-demo.html`
        *   `demos/hypercube-lattice-visualizer-demo.html`
        *   `effects/vib34d-complete-system.html`
        *   `effects/working-4d-hyperav.html`
        *   `effects/vib34d-complete-system-enhanced.html`
        *   `effects/vib34d-advanced-card-bending-system.html`
        *   `effects/tabbed-visualizer-system.html`
        *   `effects/narrative-choreography-engine.html`
        *   `effects/hypercube-core-webgl-framework.html`
        *   `effects/enhanced-color-shift-contrast-system.html`
    *   Reverted CSS `position` change for `.controls` in `effects/mvep-moire-hypercube.html`.

## Phase 2: Targeted Demo Fixes and Demo-Specific Menus (Completed)

*   **Objective:** Address specific reported issues for each demo and implement *working, demo-specific* collapsible menus where parameters need to be exposed.
*   **Prioritization:** Demos with critical functionality issues will be prioritized.
*   **Demos Addressed:**

    1.  **`demos/active-holographic-systems-mega-demo.html`**
        *   **Issue:** Not showing anything after previous modifications.
        *   **Action:** Replaced content with `demos/tech-layout-active-holographic-demo.html` to restore original functionality and style.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    2.  **`effects/mvep-moire-hypercube.html`**
        *   **Issue:** Menu non-functional, preventing access to audio reactivity parameters.
        *   **Action:** Removed custom collapsible menu CSS and modified `toggleMVEPControls()` to directly toggle `display` style of `controls-content` div. Removed initial `DOMContentLoaded` listener to start menu expanded.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    3.  **`effects/vib34d-advanced-card-bending-system.html`**
        *   **Issue:** Broken 2D bending effect.
        *   **Action:** Removed redundant `bendIntensity` multiplication from JavaScript `rotateZ`, `skewX`, and `skewY` calculations to fix the bending effect.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    4.  **`effects/enhanced-color-shift-contrast-system.html`**
        *   **Issue:** Not showing content behind its menu.
        *   **Action:** Adjusted `z-index` of `.color-controls` to `990` and `.info-panel` to `1000` to ensure proper layering and visibility.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    5.  **`effects/working-4d-hyperav.html`**
        *   **Issue:** Menu overlapping/unusable.
        *   **Action:** Implemented demo-specific collapsible menus for each control panel using CSS classes and a `togglePanel` JavaScript function. Panels now expand by default on load.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    6.  **`effects/vib34d-complete-system.html`**
        *   **Issue:** Menu issues.
        *   **Action:** Implemented demo-specific collapsible menus for the HUD and main controls using CSS classes and a `togglePanel` JavaScript function. Panels now expand by default on load.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    7.  **`demos/hypercube-lattice-visualizer-demo.html`**
        *   **Issue:** Text disappearing in menus.
        *   **Action:** Modified CSS for `.controls.collapsed .controls-content` to use `max-height: 0;` and `overflow: hidden;` instead of `opacity: 0;` and `pointer-events: none;` to ensure text is not just hidden but properly collapsed.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    8.  **`demos/active-holographic-systems-tabbed.html`**
        *   **Issue:** (To be confirmed, but likely menu-related).
        *   **Action:** Implemented demo-specific collapsible menus for the `demo-header` and `tab-navigation` sections using CSS classes and a `togglePanel` JavaScript function. Panels now expand by default on load.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    9.  **`effects/tabbed-visualizer-system.html`**
        *   **Issue:** (To be confirmed, but likely menu-related).
        *   **Action:** Implemented demo-specific collapsible menus for the `info-panel` and `tab-header` sections using CSS classes and a `togglePanel` JavaScript function. Panels now expand by default on load.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    10. **`effects/narrative-choreography-engine.html`**
        *   **Issue:** (To be confirmed, but likely menu-related).
        *   **Action:** Implemented demo-specific collapsible menus for the main controls using CSS classes and a `togglePanel` JavaScript function. Panels now expand by default on load.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    11. **`effects/hypercube-core-webgl-framework.html`**
        *   **Issue:** (To be confirmed, but likely menu-related).
        *   **Action:** Implemented demo-specific collapsible menus for the `framework-info` and `framework-controls` sections using CSS classes and a `togglePanel` JavaScript function. Panels now expand by default on load.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features and Enhancements

*   **Objective:** Implement new features or significant enhancements as identified.
*   **Current Focus:**
    1.  **Enhance `effects/mvep-moire-hypercube.html` for full audio reactivity:** Increased multipliers for audio levels within the fragment shader to make visual effects more pronounced.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    2.  **Verify and Optimize Hologram Loading/Display:** Re-examine `demos/active-holographic-systems-mega-demo.html` and `demos/active-holographic-systems-tabbed.html` to confirm that all holograms load and display correctly and efficiently.
        *   **Action:** Updated `visualizer-count` and implemented parallax for `demos/active-holographic-systems-mega-demo.html` and `demos/active-holographic-systems-tabbed.html`.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    3.  **Implement Parallax Functionality:** Add subtle, interactive parallax effects to `demos/active-holographic-systems-mega-demo.html` and `demos/active-holographic-systems-tabbed.html`, leveraging their existing depth layers to create a more immersive 3D feel.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

    4.  **Create a New "Invisible Infinite Scroll" Demo:** This will be a new, dedicated HTML file (e.g., `scroll-effects-showcase.html`). It will feature a long, invisible scrollable area that triggers and manipulates visual effects (drawing inspiration from various existing demos) as the user scrolls, creating a continuous, interactive visual journey.
        *   **Action:** Created `scroll-effects-showcase.html` with basic HTML structure, hidden scrollbar, WebGL canvas, and a scroll-responsive shader with placeholder effects. Implemented `hsv2rgb`, `rotateXW`, `rotateYW`, `rotateZW`, `project4Dto3D`, `hypercubeLattice`, and `generateMoire` functions in the shader to create more complex visual effects based on scroll progress.
        *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS.

    5.  **Generate 29 Additional Holographic Variations for `demos/active-holographic-systems-mega-demo.html`:** Modify the `TechLayoutHolographicSystem` class to programmatically create 30 instances of `HolographicVisualizer` with varied parameters and integrate them into a single, cycling display.
        *   **Action:** Modified `demos/active-holographic-systems-mega-demo.html` to display a single holographic instance that cycles through 30 unique variations. Updated CSS for full-screen display of the single instance.
        *   **Status:** FIXED.

## Phase 4: Final Integration and Documentation (Future)

*   **Objective:** Ensure all fixes are stable, documentation is updated, and the project is ready for deployment.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Comprehensive testing of all demos.
    *   Update `README.md` and other relevant documentation.
    *   Code review and refactoring for maintainability.
