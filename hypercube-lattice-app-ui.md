### Hypercube Lattice Applications UI & Effects

*   **File Path:** `/mnt/c/Users/millz/Desktop/hypercubeapp0.2/styles.css`
*   **Dependencies:** CSS3
*   **Visual Description:** The application uses a "cyberpunk" or "vaporwave" aesthetic with neon colors (pink, cyan, purple) and dark backgrounds. Each application tab has its own distinct color scheme, which is dynamically applied to various UI elements. The UI features custom sliders, toggle switches, and interactive buttons with hover effects.
*   **Key Features & Effects:**
    *   **Themed Color Palettes:** The `:root` defines a base color scheme and then specific color variables for each "universe" (Timekeeper, Sound, Spiritual, Worldbuilder). These are dynamically applied to `h2` elements, active tabs, and other components using CSS variables like `--universe-primary`.
    *   **Gradient Text:** The main `h1` title uses a `linear-gradient` for text color with a `text-shadow` for a glowing effect.
    *   **Custom Sliders:** The `dimension-slider` and other sliders have custom styling for the track and thumb, including a `linear-gradient` for the track and a glowing, circular thumb.
    *   **Toggle Switches:** Custom toggle switches are styled with a circular handle that slides across a rounded track, changing background color when active.
    *   **Synth Pad with Cursor:** The `synth-pad` in the "Soundfields Synth" tab has a `linear-gradient` background and a `synth-cursor` with a `box-shadow` for a glowing effect.
    *   **Knob Controls:** The `knob` elements have a radial gradient background and a `::after` pseudo-element to create a pointer, simulating a physical knob.
    *   **Timeline Visualization:** The "Timekeeper's Lens" tab features a `timeline-container` with a `timeline-progress` element that uses a `linear-gradient` for a visual progress bar, and `timeline-marker` and `timeline-event` elements for interactive points.
    *   **Breathing Circle Animation:** The "Spiritual Compass" tab has a `breath-circle` with a `radial-gradient` background and a `breath-indicator` that animates its `transform: scale()` property using the `@keyframes breathe` rule, creating a pulsing, breathing effect.
    *   **Interactive Buttons:** Many buttons throughout the application have hover effects that change their background, border, and add `box-shadow` for a glowing or lifted appearance.
*   **Code Highlights:**

    *   **CSS (Themed Colors & Gradient Text):**
        ```css
        :root {
            /* ... color definitions ... */
            --universe-primary: var(--timekeeper-primary); /* Default */
            /* ... */
        }

        h1 {
            background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--color-primary), var(--color-tertiary));
            -webkit-background-clip: text;
            background-clip: text;
            color: transparent;
            text-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.6);
            text-transform: uppercase;
            margin-bottom: 10px;
        }

        h2 {
            color: var(--universe-primary); /* Dynamic color */
            /* ... */
        }
        ```

    *   **CSS (Breathing Circle Animation):**
        ```css
        .breath-indicator {
            /* ... */
            animation: breathe 8s infinite ease-in-out;
            /* ... */
        }

        @keyframes breathe {
            0%, 100% { transform: scale(0.7); }
            50% { transform: scale(1); }
        }
        ```
